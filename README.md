# CodingPractice

Contains code for popular algorithms and Data Structures
along with practice questions.

## NOTE

Since these are mostly coding problems for practice, most times snakecase(instead of camelcase)
and numbering in the start of class names is used to maintain the ordering of topics sensibly
